    <p class="lead">Welcome to the The App application.</p>

    <p>The The™ App system is a project estimation and selling tool designed by The, specifically for
        your use as a valued The™ Window Film partner.</p>

    <p>This tool will allow you to quickly complete estimates for your customers by helping you organize your projects,
        as well as give you a comprehensive view of your current project hopper. This will allow you a better
        understanding of the health of your project pipeline, as well as give you a tracking mechanism to ensure
        projects continue to move through the sales cycle - all while reducing your administrative costs.</p>

    <p>The The™ App system will help reduce your glass breakage claims, as the system will flag
        windows that require a glass checklist, and enable you to complete the glass checklist within the application.
        Finally, you are also able to collect information to complete an E-Film analysis, which is a comprehensive
        building energy modeling software tool that calculates the amount of energy saved by installing The™ Window
        Film.</p>

    <p>For help on E-Film or the Glass Checklist, please consult the The™ Window Film Manual.</p>

    <p>For all other questions please contact your local The Representative.</p>
